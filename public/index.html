        <p>
          This will not be my official portfolio due to the low level displayed
          here. I am fully aware I could have invested more time with the
          design, but I am trying to become a web developer, not a visual
          designer. So all the projects made without even a logo or a 10 min
          chat to get to know the design the client wants, makes it very
          demotivating to keep creating designs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even the developer level shows skills not near good enough for any
          functional page and is behind what AI can create in seconds, no one
          will get confidence by seeing this, it looks like simple school
          deliveries, not professional projects, and that is not on me!
          Continuing wasting my time making new websites with new designs is
          practice work, and should be something I did on the side, not as 90%
          of the school.
